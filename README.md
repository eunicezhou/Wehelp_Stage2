# About this project
This website is built upon a frontend-backend separated architecture. Moreover, it follows RESTful API design principles and seamlessly integrates financial services.

### Upon load in this page
I employ CSS animations to generate dynamic effects for the HTML elements on the index page.

Also, I have implemented lazy loading to optimize the loading of data on the website.
